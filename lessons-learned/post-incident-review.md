\# Post-Incident Review (PIR) Playbook



This playbook defines how to conduct a \*\*structured, blame-free

post-incident review\*\* after a security incident.



The goal is not to assign fault, but to \*\*improve the system\*\*.



---



\## Why post-incident reviews matter



Without a review:

\- The same incidents recur

\- Detection gaps remain hidden

\- Response mistakes repeat

\- Trust in the security program erodes



Every incident is an opportunity to improve —

if the organization chooses to learn.



---



\## When to conduct a review



A post-incident review should occur when:

\- Containment actions were taken

\- Business impact was observed

\- Detection logic was exercised

\- The incident required escalation



Routine low-impact alerts may not require formal review.



---



\## Participants



A PIR should include:

\- Incident responders

\- Detection engineering

\- Platform or infrastructure owners

\- Security leadership (as appropriate)



The goal is \*\*shared understanding\*\*, not interrogation.



---



\## Review structure



\### 1. What happened

\- Timeline of key events

\- How the incident was detected

\- What actions were taken



---



\### 2. What worked well

\- Effective detections

\- Clear communication

\- Timely decisions

\- Successful containment



These strengths should be preserved.



---



\### 3. What did not work

\- Detection gaps

\- Delayed responses

\- Tooling limitations

\- Communication breakdowns



Problems should be discussed factually, not emotionally.



---



\### 4. Root cause analysis

\- Technical root causes

\- Process gaps

\- Environmental contributors



Avoid oversimplified conclusions.



---



\### 5. Action items

Each review should produce:

\- Detection improvements

\- Process changes

\- Documentation updates

\- Ownership and timelines



Action items without owners

rarely get completed.



---



\## Cultural expectations



A healthy PIR culture is:

\- Blame-free

\- Honest

\- Constructive

\- Focused on improvement



Fear suppresses learning.



---



\## Documentation and follow-up



Post-incident reviews should:

\- Be documented

\- Be accessible to relevant teams

\- Be referenced in future incidents



Learning compounds over time.



---



\## Summary



Incidents will happen.

Strong security programs improve because of them.



Post-incident reviews turn

\*\*experience into resilience\*\*.
